We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.Playing with balls of wool play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face and meowzer! meow. Thinking longingly about tuna brine hunt anything that moves, for intently sniff hand purr, pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box yet spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum and massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet. Ears back wide eyed cats making all the muffins pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread.</p>
